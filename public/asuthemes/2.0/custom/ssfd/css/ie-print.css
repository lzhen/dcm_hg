Description: Print styles for School of Social and Family Dynamics Template served specifically to Internet Explorer versions 7 and lower
*/


/* IE 6 and 7 do not support the "generated content" method of
   inserting the ASU logo from a stylesheet which is used as
   part of the ASU template to serve the same PNG file to the
   printed version of each page regardless of the screen version's
   logo color (as of 4/15/08, choices were gold and white).
   
   This workaround targets only IE 7 and lower and sends the
   browser a background image of the gold logo. Unfortunately,
   this is not a perfect solution because users will need to
   turn on background image printing for the logo to show up. */
