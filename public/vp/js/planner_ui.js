It proposes that we are moving towards a hybrid (physical-digital) existence and culture. It traces that evolution, looks at current examples of hybrid cultural processes and outcomes and discusses possible future trends. It discusses how these changes are influencing the work and career possibilities of people involved in all aspects of human culture. The syllabus comprises diverse readings, media products, class interaction, group discussion and hands on collaborative projects exploring concepts covered in class. A number of guest lectures from faculty members from HIDA, FSE, and CLAS are also included.

The course seeks to provide the student with a historical, theoretical, aesthetic, conceptual and technical introduction to the challenges and opportunities presented by the relatively recent collision of art, culture and computing power. In the course, we will view a broad range of contemporary and historical work by artists who use the digital computer as subject matter, production tool and artistic medium (sometimes all at once). Lectures are organized around principle areas of inquiry and practice in the field and are intended to provide a framework for considering a wide range of digital and electronic creative practices. During discussion sections, students will discuss the required readings, highlighted artworks, and delve deeper into topics introduced during lectures. During weekly labs, students will be introduced to and access basic software and hardware tools and will be challenged to develop their creative and technical skills through the creation of original art projects. Lab sections will also guide students through the public presentation and group critique of their projects. Inside and outside of class you will see and interact with artwork (including works found online, on DVDs, CD-ROMs, and videotape) as well as other cultural artifacts of the digital age, from computer console games to online chat rooms. This relatively new field of artistic exploration has grown exponentially in the past decade, and continues to grow and develop, offering many opportunities for new creative work, new theoretical insights, and new discoveries.

It has been hailed as a way to cure everything from world hunger to bad breath. Nevertheless, technological development has not been an unqualified blessing. Technologies frequently have negative side effects. But because technology is justifiably seen as indispensable in solving current problems and ensuring a better future, societies have chosen not to abandon technology, but to shape and direct it. This class will explore the relationship between technology and society in an effort to find ways to create better futures. We will continually pose three important questions. First, how does technology shape our world? We will explore the variety of ways by which machines and techniques become embedded in society and thereby shape institutions, relationships, and values. Second, what kind of future do we want? Many of the articles we will read argue that certain values are of key importance to a just society and challenge us to consider which values we should hold most dear and defend. And third, how can we make decisions about technology that will get us to the future we want?

It has been hailed as a way to cure everything from world hunger to bad breath. Nevertheless, technological development has not been an unqualified blessing. Technologies frequently have negative side effects. But because technology is justifiably seen as indispensable in solving current problems and ensuring a better future, societies have chosen not to abandon technology, but to shape and direct it. This class will explore the relationship between technology and society in an effort to find ways to create better futures. We will continually pose three important questions. First, how does technology shape our world? We will explore the variety of ways by which machines and techniques become embedded in society and thereby shape institutions, relationships, and values.

By the end of the term students should also have attained a firm theoretical context on issues pertaining to computation and design."},                          "13sanp494dhs":  { "title": "ANP494 Designing Hybrid Spaces",  					"description": "One of the principle tasks of a building is to shelter people from external climate conditions. The facade or building skin is the primary subsystem through which external conditions can be influenced to meet the comfort requirements of the users inside the building. The building skin defines the relationship between interior and exterior spaces. This course will focus on the potential of intelligent building skins achievable through the use of digital technologies and material innovation. In addition to studying various building skins found in contemporary architecture such as The Water Cube by PTW Architects, the Sendai Mediatheque by Toyo Ito, and the Novartis Office Building by Frank Gehry, students will also investigate the potential for responsive and performative facades such as the IC Solar Facade research project by Anna Dyson. Students will be asked to design a building skin which addresses issues of sustainability, material innovation, and performance. Final designs will be communicated through digital models, renderings, and animations."},  "14sanp494dhs":  { "title": "ANP494 Designing Hybrid Spaces",  					"description": "One of the principle tasks of a building is to shelter people from external climate conditions.
